# Paint_Job_Estimator

This program calculates the total cost needed in order to paint the inputted square feet of wall space.

It takes the paint charges and the labor charges and adds them together and then multiplies that total by the 
inputted state sales tax. The program then tells you how much it will cost in total in order to paint that section of the wall.
